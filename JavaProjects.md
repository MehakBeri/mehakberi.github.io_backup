### Address Book
This program functions as an address book. It has entries containing the following information: 
- first and last name
- phone number
- address
- email address

The following functionality is implemented:
- Add entries, remove and print out entries
- Save entries to a file
- Read in entries from a file 
- Sort the entries by any field (first name, last name, phone number, email address, etc)
- Easily and intelligently handles the use of multiple address books (multiple files)
- Ability to move an entry from one address book to another.

### Nim Game
Nim is a strategy game between two players. This project implements the Nim game between a player and an intelligent computer.

Following are the rules for the Nim game:
- Start by placing counters (coins or toothpicks or something) into 3 piles.
- Player #1 picks a pile, then removes one or more counters from that pile. (It's okay to take the whole pile.)
- Player #2 picks a pile, then removes one or more counters from that pile.
- Player #1 plays again. (It's okay to choose a different pile this time.)
- Whichever player is forced to take the last counter is the LOSER.

### Black Jack
Program that allows a human user to play a simplified version of Blackjack against a computer opponent. The rules are as follows:

- Don't worry about suits or face cards; "cards" will have values from 2-11, and all values are equally likely (that is, unlike a real blackjack game, there's no greater chance of drawing a card with value 10).
- Draw two cards for the player and display them.
- Draw two cards for the "dealer" and display one of them, keeping the other one hidden.
- Allow the player to "hit" as many times as he would like.
- If the player "busts" (gets a total over 21), the dealer automatically wins.
- Allow the dealer to hit as many times as he would like. Dealer should probably hit on sixteen or lower.
- If the dealer busts, the player automatically wins.
- Assuming no one has busted, the player with the highest total wins. Dealer wins all ties.

### Tic Tac Toe
An interactive two player game of tic tac toe implemented in Java.
[Here](https://github.com/MehakBeri/Tic-tac-toe-in-java) is the Github repo for this project.

### Hangman
An interactive word-guessing game with the following rules:
- It must randomly choose a word from a list of words.
- It must stop when all the letters are guessed.
- It must give them limited tries and stop after they run out.
- It must display letters they have already guessed (either only the incorrect guesses or all guesses).
