I am a self learner in data science. I follow tutorials from Coursera and Kaggle and have successfully learnt the basics of Data Science techniques like Classification, Correlation, Data modelling and Data prediction.The projects below have been made using Python Pandas, Numpy, Sci-kit, Jupyter notebooks: 

- [Money Spent Vs Life Expectancy at Birth](https://github.com/MehakBeri/Data-Science/blob/master/DS%2BMiniProject.ipynb)
