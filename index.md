## About Me
Hi! I am Mehak Beri, a Machine Learning Intern at Samsung Austin R&D Center, as well as a Computer Science MS student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am passionate about data, crazy hacks to solve impossible problems and the subtle art of visualization. 

I have two international publications to my credit, one of which features in [IEEE Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7238520/?reload=true). I am a creative person and have had an experience of working in an Indian IT company called Gemini Solutions, as a software developer and an Experiential Instructor. I am a NI [certified LABVIEW associate developer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/c6a933f3-0cd1-47f9-9b13-39095aa577af) as well. I am a developer, a teacher, a writer, a researcher, a leader and most importantly a verocious learner.
