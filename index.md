## About Me
I am a Computer Science graduate student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am a NI [certified LABVIEW associate developer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/c6a933f3-0cd1-47f9-9b13-39095aa577af). I am a developer, a teacher, a writer, a researcher, a leader and most importantly a verocious learner. 
You can find my detailed work experience and skillset in my [resume](MehakBeri_Resume.pdf), or in my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehakberi/). I also have two international publications to my credit, one of which features in [IEEE Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7238520/?reload=true).
